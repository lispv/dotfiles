# Deprecated Dotfiles

These are dotfiles that are no longer used, either because I do not use the utility or made a new configuration.

## Mutt

> Last updated: 2022-07-23

It's the best CLI email client.
But that doesn't say a lot these days where all emails are essentially embedded HTML websites.
Even with `w3m` integration, I found myself not using Mutt at all as I always have Thunderbird open on my computer.

## Qutebrowser

Firefox + Vimium add-on is good enough for me.

## Midnight Commander

> Last updated: 2023-08-08

It's a decent file manager, especially when dealing with a large number of files.
However, it's slow to launch, keybindings are atrocious, and features are generally not intuitive to use.
For browsing directories quickly, I use [lf](../lf/lfrc), and when I need to bulk-rename files/directories, I prefer [Emacs Dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) or [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim).

## Neofetch

> Last updated: 2023-08-24

Neofetch is deprecated as of 2024-04-26.
I was looking for a replacement and tried out:

- [FastFetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch)
- [HyFetch](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/hyfetch)
- [NerdFetch](https://github.com/ThatOneCalculator/NerdFetch)
- [screenFetch](https://github.com/KittyKatt/screenFetch)

Then I realized that they are basically the same thing and that I really do not need any *fetch program.
